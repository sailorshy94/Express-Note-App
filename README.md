# Express-Note-App

## Description
The goal of this challenge was to build the code for the back-end of the Note Taker application, and connect it to the front-end of the application. Express.js is used to create the back-end of this application and handle server requests. It is used to retrieve data from notes submitted on the webpage and retrieves said data as a JSON file. This application also uses Nano ID (referenced in Technology used) to generate a unique id for each note saved. The Note Taker application back-end uses both HTML and API routing to serve the appropriate webpages depending on where the user navigates, as well as using the wildcard * to serve as a redirect to the homepage. This application is deployed using Heroku.

## Technology Used
This application uses Nano ID version 3.x created by Andrey Sitnik.
